Please Read Scenario:

"To encourage good grades, Kagman High School has decided to award each ­student a bookstore credit at NMC that is 10 times the student’s grade point average for each semester each year.  In other words, a student with a 2.0-grade point average receives a $20 credit and of course the higher the grade point the greater the bookstore credit.  Over four years of High School, this will calculate out to potentially more than $160. This is designed to encourage students from Kagman to attend NMC and prepare for college."

Objectives of Your Code:

Your assignment is to create a class called NMCKagmanBookFund. When you run the program it will prompt a student for the following:

a name, 
a grade point average, 
a year and 
a semester for only one year.  
This means that you will need to request some information four times (once for each year of their HS career). The values should be passed and assigned to variables that you need to create.  
Once all the assigned values from those variables are collected, the data must be passed to a method that displays a descriptive message about the fours of data.

The ­message will use the student’s name, and echoes the grade point average for each semester for that each year, and computes and ­displays the total credit earned for the NMC Bookstore.

Below is an example final data to be displayed:

Student:   JERARD BUTLER

                  Y1(2018)       Y2(2019)      Y3 (2020)      Y4 (2021)      

GPA:              2.5                  3.2.                3.8.                 3.9.                 

CREDIT:       $20.50.         $30.20.          $30.80.         $30.90.

=================================================              

FINAL BOOK STORE CREDIT:          $112.4



Save the application as ­ NMCKagmanBookFund.java." Please include in your code a commented section at the top that includes:

Your Name
